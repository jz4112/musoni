Technologies leveraged:

We implemented most of the user interface of our Android application in JavaScript using WebViews; in order to test the appearance of the user interface, we used both team members' Android phones as well as an emulator available in the Android Development Toolkit.

The back-end of our application, such as the handling of data structures and network connections, was implemented in Java using the Eclipse IDE.

To manage our code, we used the git version control tool to keep track of our code as well as to ensure that errors could easily be recovered from.

Finally, to test our code, we used the aforementioned Android emulators; for the Java code, we also used JUnit to perform unit tests for various methods (most significantly, the data-validation procedures) in the back-end.
